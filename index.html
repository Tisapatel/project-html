              <h1>
                Gwendolyne Stacy (Earth-2004)
              </h1>
              <p>Gwen Stacy was born in Forest Hills to George and Helen Stacy. Following her mother's death, she was raised by George alone. Gwen's free spirit and artistic inclinations often put her at odds with the type of ethics her father worked to instill. As a result of this contrast with her father, Gwen would often retreat into quiet seclusion and play the drums.</p>
              <p>
                Over time, she developed a friendship with her neighbor and fellow introvert Peter Parker, sharing their love for music.[26] At Midtown High School, Gwen developed relationships with other students, a group of girls with whom she formed the band, The Mary Janes and rebellious affluent student Harry Osborn.
                After being bitten by a genetically-engineered spider, Gwen was granted arachnid-like super-powers, and started a career as a crimefighter, dubbed by the media as "Spider-Woman".

                After being bitten by a genetically-engineered spider, Gwen was granted arachnid-like super-powers, and started a career as a crimefighter, dubbed by the media as "Spider-Woman." She was given a costume and a set of web-shooters by retired crimefighter Janet van Dyne. Gwen spent most of her early adventures focused on exploiting and maintaining her newfound attention more than helping those in need; however, Gwen's behavior changed after her father expressed he believed Spider-Woman could easily help people.

                GWEN STORY
              </h2>
              <p>As it was never specified whether Miles Warren kidnapped and cloned Gwen before or after she and Peter got married, it could be possible that it was Gwen's clone who was actually married to Peter.</p>
              <p>
                In 1966, Gwen was present when Flash Thompson left to fight in the Vietnam War, but she remained at the train station, waiting for Peter Parker to show up.
              </p>
              <p>Haunted by Peter's death, Gwen doubled her efforts to fight crime to redeem herself. Additionally, Gwen's father George was tasked with conducting the NYPD investigation to capture Spider-Woman. This drew the attention of Matt Murdock - a corrupt lawyer, leader of the Hand ninja, and the right hand and successor to New York's Kingpin of crime - who sent hitman Aleksei Sytsevich to kill George in an attempt to make an ally of Spider-Woman. After thwarting the murder attempt, Gwen found herself held at gunpoint by her father, and she was forced to reveal her double identity. She pleaded her innocence, and swore to never rest until criminals like the Kingpin were stopped. Captain Stacy told her to leave the scene before he changed his mind.</p>
